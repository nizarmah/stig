# train

Train the AI using recordings.

## Setup

### Recordings

First, you need to record some data. You can do that using the [game client][game-client].

Once you have some recordings, we can continue.

## Run

From the root directory of this repository, run:

```bash
make stig-train
```

[game-client]: ../../../game
